# **Learnings about Graphs -- C**

- ### **What is a graph dudes?**

  **Short answer** => A **graph** is a set of nodes - called <i>vertices</i> - and connections - called <i>edges</i>- connecting the different vertices. <br>
  **Graphs** are used to represent **networks.**
  In Computer Science, graph is a **data structure** that is used to represent connections or relationships between objects.

- ### **What are vertices and edges**

  The **vertices** can represent anything from cities in a map to web-pages in a network, whereas **edges** can represent the relationships between them, such as roads or links.
  The **vertices** can be seen as a collection of points (nodes) connected by "lines" **edges**, where each **vertex** represents a <i>point of interest</i> and each **edge** represents a <i>connection between two points.</i>

  #### <i><strong>Concerning <s>Hobbits</s> Edges</strong></i> <br>

  Edges can be **directed** or **undirected**, we represent an edge as a pair E = (u, v) u and v being its both endpoints. Directed is like a one-way street and undirected is just like a regular street with double-way circulation traffic. <br>
  This leads us to the notion of directed/undirected Graphs...

- ### **What are the different types of graphs (directed, weighted,...)**

**Undirected** => if a graph is labelized 'undirected', it must satisfy the property that all edges are bidirectional (Analogy => bit like a city with absolutely NO One-way street).

**Directed** => directed graphs or 'di-graphs' are graphs which contains hence <i>directed edges</i>, meaning that all the edges have a specific direction
(imagine a hell-city with only one way-streets).

..................................
<h6> Undirected Polymorphism </h6>
We can always re-draw an <i>undirected graph</i> as <i>directed</i> -> for each undirected edge we will have 2 directed edges, but the opposite is false <br>
.................................

**Weighted** => We also can add a 'notion' of "weight" to the edges. Pursuing our analogy of city / roads and Blabla stuff, We can imagine to "weight" some certain roads regarding to their lenghts or periodic traffic jam... to specify that these "edges" are gonna cost us more time or money or anxiety or fish & chips ! USeful to pick the best path to reach destination.

**Unweighted** => a cool graph with all edges having weight == 1 unit. Equality, fraternity, peace.

- ### **What are the most common ways used to represent graphs in C**

There are different ways to represent a graph structure in C, the choice is situation-specific, and comes with its pros&cons, here are two standards methods:

- **Adjacency matrix**
 A 2D array that represents the graph by storing a '1' at position (i, j), if there's an edge from vertex i to j, and 0 otherwise. <br>

  |            |   A  |  B  |  C  |  D  |
  | -----------| ---- | ----| ----| ----|
  |   A        |  0   |  1  |  1  |  0  |
  |  B         |  1   |  0  |  0  |  1  |
  |  C         |  1   |  0  |  0  |  0  |
  |  D         |  0   |  1  |  1  |  0  |

In this matrix, we learn for example that the graph contains edges from A to B and A to C.

- **Basic Adjacency list**
Adjacency List is a simple way to represent a graph as a list of vertices, where each vertex has a list of its adjacent vertices. An example for an undirected graph with 4 vertices would give the following: <br>

A: B D
B: A C
C: B D
D: A C

=> Here vertex A is adjacent to vertices B and D and so on...

```
         -----       -----
        |  B  |-----|  C  |
       / -----     / -----
      /           /
-----/           /
| A |           /
-----\         /
      \  -----/
       \|  D  |
         -----

```

- **Holberton_custom_made Adjacency Linked List!**

In the folder of this project, the header file [graphs.h](./graphs.h) declares all the structs necessary for using this architecture. <br>
The main layout/principle remains the same as **Basic Adjacency List** but instead of having an <i>array of vertices</i> we rather use a <i>singly linked list of vertices</i>, by doing so, we will be able to add vertices to the graph, without having to realloc the entire array every time (That's what we learn back in the days of Singly Linked list discovering in our youth).
