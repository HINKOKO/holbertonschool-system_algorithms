# **General Learnings from the project**

- ## **What is Pathfinding ?**

Pathfinding algorithms deal with the problem of finding a 'path' from a source to a target point, avoiding obstacles and minimizing the costs (time, resources...). This a common programming challenge. Mainly applied to navigation or games, it is actually applied to a wide range of real-life problems.

- ## **What is 'backtracking', and why you should never use it**

BAcktracking is a general algorithm for solving some computational problems, that **incrementally builds candidates to the solution and abandon's candidate's backtracks as soon as it discover that the candidate cannot be anymore part of the solution.** (Used for famous N-Queens problem, maze solving, search for all Hamilton paths in graphs).Kind of using 'brute force' to find all solutions to a problem.
