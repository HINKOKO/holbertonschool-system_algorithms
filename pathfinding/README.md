# **C - Pathfinding**

<quote>Getting lost along your path is a part of finding the path you are meant to be on</quote><br>
=> This happened a LOT during the exercises in this folder ðŸ˜†

**Pathfinding** in computer science : fundamental technique used to find shortest or more "efficient" , the "cheaper" path between two points, for example in a network or a (weighted) graph. <br>
At first, we play with **recursive-backtracking** ("plÃ©onasme" in French)to demonstrate that backtracking a Graph can take a relatively high amount of computation, even if the solution is "close" so to speak.

## **Tasks**

**0. Backtracking - Array**

<i>Write a function that searches for the first path from a starting point to a target point within a two-dimensional array.</i>

Prototype: queue_t *backtracking_array(char \*\*map, int rows, int cols, point_t const *start, point_t const \*target);

- map is the pointer to a read-only two-dimensional array
- A 0 represents a walkable cell
- A 1 represents a blocked cell
- rows and cols are respectively the number of rows and columns of map
- start stores the coordinates of the starting point
- target stores the coordinates of the target point
- Your function must return a queue, in which each node is a point in the path from start to target (See example)
- Youâ€™ll have to use recursive backtracking to find the first working path from start to target
- For each visited cell, youâ€™ll have to explore neighbour cells in the following order:
  RIGHT, BOTTOM, LEFT, TOP

**1. Backtracking - Graph**

<i>Write a function that searches for the first path from a starting point to a target point in a graph.</i>

Prototype: queue_t *backtracking_graph(graph_t *graph, vertex_t const *start, vertex_t const *target);

- graph is a pointer to the graph to go through
- start is a pointer to the starting vertex
- target is a pointer to the target vertex
- Your function must return a queue, in which each node is a char \* corresponding to a vertex, forming a path from start to target.
- Youâ€™ll have to use recursive backtracking to find the first working path from start to target
- Youâ€™ll have to print each visited vertex.
