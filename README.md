## **Algorithms rules the world**

**ALGORITHMS** may sound terrifying at first. It simply means a ***step-by-step procedure or a set of rules to accomplish a specific task, or solve a problem.***

More than ever, **Algorithms** play a significant role in shaping the world we live in today. Automation, Information & Search engines, Social media, E-Commerce & personalized advertising, Financial markets, Trading, Machine Learning, Transportation or Scientific research and many more... they are everywhere and you're certainly a liar if you' say : I never heard the word "algorithm".


At [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/programmes/blockchain), in the ***Low Level & Algorithms*** specialization, we are challenged with advanced data structures and algorithms, such as Red-Black-Trees, N-ary trees, Graphs or Data structure related to Blockchain technology.

In this repository, you'll find folders about Red-Black trees (only this one so far), N-ary trees, Graphs and Blockchain.

## **About me**

Started retraining in May 2022 with Holberton School, after 14 years as a construction worker ! I quickly became passionate about computer science, and aimed at pursuing the fundamentals with a Low Level Specialization, because my curiosity is endless and that Low-Level path gives us a real insight into the bare-bones of advanced Algorithms and Linux inner workings.
Thanks !
